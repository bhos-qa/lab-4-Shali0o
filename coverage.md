### 1. **Statement Coverage**
Statement coverage ensures that each line of code is executed at least once during testing. Its goal is to verify that no code goes untested, which helps in identifying unexecuted code sections.

### 2. **Branch Coverage**
Branch coverage measures whether all possible paths (true/false outcomes) from decision points like `if` and `switch` are executed. This ensures that every logical branch in the code is tested for its different outcomes.

### 3. **Predicate Coverage**
Predicate coverage focuses on testing the truth or falsity of every condition within complex boolean expressions. It ensures that all possible combinations of boolean variables are evaluated to catch logic errors.
